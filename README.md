# Welcome to the funding repo.

This is the first page that will tell you about how the funding works. It's going to be an overview and a simple guide. You will learn how your can submit ideas, apply for funding and monitor the stages of proposals (look at the 'projects'tab).

## Overview of the process

* 00 - Open Problem Statements (OPS). Used by the council to indicate areas we're especially interested in funding.
* 01 - Ideas. Big ideas are 'issues', and small fixes are 'pull requests'.
* 02 - Review. Our team presents the ideas to the ambassadors for review and a vote.
* 03 - Publish 'Requests for Proposals'. Approved ideas have a 'Request for Proposal' written, and published in 'issues' with an 'RFP' label.
* 04 - Invite Proposals. The community and our team can invite proposals. Must include a timeline and milestones for funding.
* 05 - Scoring. Ambassadors score proposals based on weighting set out in the RFP. A summary of the final scores shared in the comments.
* 06 - Council Approval. The council sign-off on the projects that have been selected through scoring before funding can be released.
* 07 - Award Project Status. A proposal becomes a project and milestones are set to indicate when phases of funding are released. 
* 08 - Case Studies. Successful projects end with a post-mortem to measure success and help future projects learn from previous experience.
* 09 Closed. All ideas or issues that not taken further are visible here with feedback.

## How to submit your first idea

We'll explain how to submit a suggestion through the 'issues' tab, how to keep track of where funding is being awarded and the milestones that projects have met.

This is a page we'll need to write copy for. It's the landing page for funding.

- requests for proposals RFPS
- open problem statements
- projects that have had fundings awarded and milestones they've completed
- success 

A document we want to create is a ISO Procurement Policy and Procedures like this (but simpler)  https://www.iso.org/files/live/sites/isoorg/files/about%20ISO/working_with_iso/docs/Procurement_Procedures.pdf

## Terms and Conditions

Submitting an idea does not guarantee you will receive funding to execute it if it's approved. Our funding model separates and rewards idea submissions from awarding funding to implement ideas. If you submit an idea and it is accepted, anyone including yourself can write a proposal for funding for it. 

The decision as to award funding is entirely made at the discretion of the Cardano's Ambassadors and requires sign off from The Council.

* By submitting an idea, application or contribution, an individual or organization agrees:
* To use any support provided solely for the project described in the funding request and to provide documentation supporting this use, if requested,
* To exercise control or coordination over the supported project,
* To be willing to disclose that The Cardano Foundation provided financial support,
* To meet with potential collaborators within The Cardano Foundation to participate in projects effort.
* To release the results as open-source under MIT license, if feasible.
* We reserve the right to change the terms and conditions, including cancelling the program at any time without notice. 

Please note that you are responsible for complying with taxes and laws, and you agree to provide us with enough information, at our request, so that we can comply with all relevant laws and regulations.
