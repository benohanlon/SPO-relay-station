# Welcome to the funding repo.

This is the first page that will tell you about how the funding works. It's going to be an overview and a simple guide. You will learn how your can submit ideas, apply for funding and monitor the stages of proposals (look at the 'projects'tab).

## Overview of the process

* 00 - Open Problem Statements (OPS). Used by the council to indicate areas we're especially interested in funding.
* 01 - Ideas. Big ideas are 'issues', and small fixes are 'pull requests'.
* 02 - Review. Our team presents the ideas to the ambassadors for review and a vote.
* 03 - Publish 'Requests for Proposals'. Approved ideas have a 'Request for Proposal' written, and published in 'issues' with an 'RFP' label.
* 04 - Invite Proposals. The community and our team can invite proposals. Must include a timeline and milestones for funding.
* 05 - Scoring. Ambassadors score proposals based on weighting set out in the RFP. A summary of the final scores shared in the comments.
* 06 - Council Approval. The council sign-off on the projects that have been selected through scoring before funding can be released.
* 07 - Award Project Status. A proposal becomes a project and milestones are set to indicate when phases of funding are released. 
* 08 - Case Studies. Successful projects end with a post-mortem to measure success and help future projects learn from previous experience.
* 09 Closed. All ideas or issues that not taken further are visible here with feedback.

## How to submit your first idea

We'll explain how to submit a suggestion through the 'issues' tab, how to keep track of where funding is being awarded and the milestones that projects have met.

This is a page we'll need to write copy for. It's the landing page for funding.

- requests for proposals RFPS
- open problem statements
- projects that have had fundings awarded and milestones they've completed
- success 

A document we want to create is a ISO Procurement Policy and Procedures like this (but simpler)  https://www.iso.org/files/live/sites/isoorg/files/about%20ISO/working_with_iso/docs/Procurement_Procedures.pdf
