# Welcome to the funding repo.

This is the first page that will tell you about how the funding works. It's going to be an overview and a simple guide. You will be told how to submit ideas, how to monitor the stages of proposals by looking at the 'projects' in the top tab.

We'll explain how to submit a suggestion through the 'issues' tab, how to keep track of where funding is being awarded and the milestones that projects have met.

This is a page we'll need to write copy for. It's the landing page for funding.

- requests for proposals RFPS
- open problem statements
- projects that have had fundings awarded and milestones they've completed
- success 

A document we want to create is a ISO Procurement Policy and Procedures like this (but simpler)  https://www.iso.org/files/live/sites/isoorg/files/about%20ISO/working_with_iso/docs/Procurement_Procedures.pdf
